                      Its a big site when it is consideration of portfolio. And
                      I am very new to graphql, next js and tailwind css. As I
                      have made this completely alone, in some cases I had to go
                      through many troubles finding solutions, where I have used
                      bad practise solutions. But it works. As a example, though
                      its a grocery site, all the products here related to
                      shopping üòÅüòÅ. Because I dont have good grocery images.

                      As I have learned those technologies completely by myself

                      mistakes. I believe youtube and google is not enough to go
                      dept of those technologies and make big projects. As I
                      have achieved those, I am very very confident that, I can
                      achieve more if I have a chance working with your company.
